        <p>
           My name is Marium Akmal, and I am a first-year Computer Science undergraduate at Punjab University College of Information Technology (PUCIT).
I am currently focused on learning front-end web development and understanding how websites are built from scratch.
<br><br>
Right now, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I also have a solid foundation in C programming.
I enjoy experimenting with layouts, styling, and small interactions, and I am slowly building confidence in my coding skills.
<br><br>
I am especially interested in artificial intelligence and robotics, and I like reading and learning about how intelligent systems work.
These interests motivate me to keep improving my technical skills.
<br><br>
Outside of coding, I enjoy baking and watching animated movies, which help me relax and stay creative.
<br><br>
My goal is to complete my degree, gain practical experience in tech, and later pursue a Masters degree.
I hope to work on projects that combine web development and artificial intelligence in a meaningful way.
